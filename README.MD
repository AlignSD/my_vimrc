#Welcome to my vimrc. Please feel free to pull and use/modify this as you see fit.


### Package Manager:
 - I'm using packer as my vimrc plugin/package manager. see [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) for installation instructions.

### Plugins
 - Markdown Preview plugin. see [iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim) 

### Important For Windows Users
 - Windows can't handle the default Ctrl-Z binding for NeoVim which is supposed to suspend the application.
 I have decided to just unmap it to prevent unwanted freezes and/or lost work.
